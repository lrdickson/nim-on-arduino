# Nim on Arduino

This is an example of how to use Nim to generate C code that can be digested by the Arduino build tools.

This code has been tested using the [Seeeduino XIAO](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO/).

## Usage

Assuming that you have a Seeeduino XIAO available at /dev/ttyACM0, run the following command:

	sudo docker-compose up --build

## Contribution

I am still learning about Nim, Arduino and embedded programming. If this example can be improved, feel free to create an issue or pull request.
